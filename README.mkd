This mp3 player can load playlists in the [XSPF format](http://xspf.org/)

The organisation of the code is such that there is an MP3Player class (gratefully
ripped off and tweakd from http://unformatt.com/news/as3-mp3-player/ !!) that
exposes a nice simple API and broadcasts useful events that you can build your
interface off of.

The rest of the 'view' part of the code is pretty much just an example and you'd
switch it out. Shows how to display a playlist, progress bar, volume control etc.
